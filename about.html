      <p>La Réunion is a dot in the Indian Ocean. As one of the thirteen french overseas territories, the island is separated from the metropole by 10 000 kilometers. This research investigates the long distance relationship between the french «hexagone» and one of its oversea territory. <br> The first phase of the project revealed the great level of ignorance regarding this french department. This statement highlights the limited visibility of la Réunion in the Métropole and abroad. </p>
       <p>Collaborating with Reunionese living in the mainland was necessary to get an insight on the feeling of belonging to the French identity. <br> During this investigation, a clear generational gap appeared across the multiple testimonies. While the older generation still percieves France as a saving «mother country», the younger generation starts questioning the role of the hexagone regarding their island. This debate is key to the identity affirmation of the Reunionese youth, who already faces social issues. </p>
       <p>Dialogues, arguments, interactions requiere a platform to broadcast and archive. The radio format allows unlimited possibilities of audio interventions and guaranties a democratic access to it. This work of mediation could give a voice to an unnoticed part of the french population and the oportunity for the reunionese youth to manifest their opinions. </p>
